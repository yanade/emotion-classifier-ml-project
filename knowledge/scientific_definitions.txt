Sadness
A negative emotional state triggered by perceived loss, helplessness, or unmet needs.
Biologically, sadness decreases physiological arousal, promotes withdrawal, reflection, and signals a need for social support. It often follows loss, separation, or disappointment.
Joy
A positive emotional state associated with pleasure, reward, and well-being.
It increases dopamine and endorphin activity, facilitates social bonding, motivates exploration, and reinforces behaviors that improve survival or connection.
Love
A complex emotional system integrating attachment, bonding, and caregiving responses.
It involves oxytocin, dopamine, and long-term neural pathways that promote safety, trust, cooperation, and long-term affiliation with individuals or groups.
Anger
A high-arousal emotional response to perceived threat, injustice, or obstruction.
It activates the sympathetic nervous system (increasing heart rate, muscle tension, adrenaline) and motivates confrontation, boundary protection, or problem-solving.
Fear
An intense emotional response to danger or threat (real or anticipated).
It activates the amygdala and fight-flight-freeze mechanisms, preparing the body for rapid survival actions through increased arousal, vigilance, and risk assessment.
Surprise
A brief emotional reaction to unexpected events.
It rapidly shifts attention, increases sensory intake, and prepares the body to evaluate novel stimuli. Surprise can transition into other emotions depending on context (fear, joy, curiosity).
